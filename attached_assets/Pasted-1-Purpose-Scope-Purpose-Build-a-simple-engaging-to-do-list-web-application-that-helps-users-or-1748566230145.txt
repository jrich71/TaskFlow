 • Habit-forming mechanics (streaks, points/rewards)
 • Data visualization (GitHub-style heatmap)
 • Secure user authentication

2. Objectives & Success Metrics

4. User Stories
Authentication


As a new user, I want to sign up and verify my email so I can securely access the app.


As a returning user, I want to log in with my credentials so I can resume managing my tasks.


Task Management


As a user, I want to add a new task with title, optional description, start date, due date, and category so I can plan and prioritize my work.


As a user, I want to edit or delete a task so I can keep my list up to date.


Categories


As a user, I want to create and assign categories (e.g., “Work,” “Personal”) so I can filter and group my tasks.


Dashboard & Visualization


As a user, I want to see an at-a-glance dashboard showing upcoming tasks, active streak, and total points so I stay motivated.


As a user, I want a GitHub-style heatmap of days vs. tasks completed so I can visualize my consistency over time.


Streaks & Rewards


As a user, I want to earn a streak by completing at least one task per day so I build healthy habits.


As a user, I want to accumulate points or badges for each streak milestone (e.g., 7-day streak) so I feel rewarded.
