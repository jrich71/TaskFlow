## **1\. Purpose & Scope**

**Purpose:**  
 Build a simple, engaging to-do list web application that helps users organize tasks, track daily progress, and build positive habits through streaks and rewards.

**Scope:**  
 • Core user-facing features (dashboard, task CRUD, categories)  
 • Habit-forming mechanics (streaks, points/rewards)  
 • Data visualization (GitHub-style heatmap)  
 • Secure user authentication

---

## **2\. Objectives & Success Metrics**

| Objective | Metric |
| ----- | ----- |
| Enable users to manage tasks easily | ≥80% task creation-to-completion rate |
| Increase daily engagement | ≥5 daily active users (initial goal) |
| Foster habit formation via streaks | 30-day average streak ≥10 days |
| Provide clear visual progress feedback | ≥90% of users interact with graph |

## **3\. User Personas**

* **“Busy Bee”**: Juggles work and side projects; needs quick task entry and overview.

* **“Habit-Builder”**: Wants to cultivate daily routines; motivated by streaks & rewards.

* **“Organizer”**: Prefers categorizing & filtering tasks; values structure.

---

## **4\. User Stories**

1. **Authentication**

   * *As a new user*, I want to sign up and verify my email so I can securely access the app.

   * *As a returning user*, I want to log in with my credentials so I can resume managing my tasks.

2. **Task Management**

   * *As a user*, I want to add a new task with title, optional description, start date, due date, and category so I can plan and prioritize my work.

   * *As a user*, I want to edit or delete a task so I can keep my list up to date.

3. **Categories**

   * *As a user*, I want to create and assign categories (e.g., “Work,” “Personal”) so I can filter and group my tasks.

4. **Dashboard & Visualization**

   * *As a user*, I want to see an at-a-glance dashboard showing upcoming tasks, active streak, and total points so I stay motivated.

   * *As a user*, I want a GitHub-style heatmap of days vs. tasks completed so I can visualize my consistency over time.

5. **Streaks & Rewards**

   * *As a user*, I want to earn a streak by completing at least one task per day so I build healthy habits.

   * *As a user*, I want to accumulate points or badges for each streak milestone (e.g., 7-day streak) so I feel rewarded.

## **5\. Functional Requirements**

### **5.1 User Authentication**

* **Sign Up:** email, password, confirmation

* **Log In / Log Out**

* **Password Reset:** via email link

* **Session Management:** JWT or secure cookies

### **5.2 Dashboard**

* **Overview Cards:**

  * “Tasks Due Today” (count & list)

  * “Upcoming Tasks” (next 7 days)

  * “Current Streak” (days in a row)

  * “Points Balance”

* **Quick Add Task:** inline form for title \+ category

### **5.3 Task CRUD**

* **Create Task Form:**

  * Title (required)

  * Description (optional)

  * Category (dropdown)

  * Start Date (datepicker)

  * Due Date (datepicker)

* **Edit/Delete Task** from task list or detail view

### **5.4 Categories**

* **Create / Rename / Delete Categories**

* **Assign Task to Category**

* **Filter Tasks** by category on dashboard and list view

### **5.5 Streaks & Rewards**

* **Streak Logic:**

  * Reset if zero completions on any calendar day

  * Increment when ≥1 task completed in a day

* **Points System:**

  * \+1 point per completed task

  * Bonus points for streak milestones (e.g., \+10 points at 7-day mark)

* **Notifications:**

  * Daily email/push reminder if streak in danger

### **5.6 Progress Visualization**

* **Heatmap Chart:**

  * X-axis: weekdays

  * Y-axis: calendar weeks/months

  * Cell intensity: number of tasks completed that day

  * Tooltip on hover: date \+ count

* **Toggle Views:** weekly / monthly / all-time

## **6\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:**

  * Page load \< 200 ms (with \<100 tasks)

  * API responses \< 300 ms

* **Security:**

  * Encrypt passwords (bcrypt or Argon2)

  * HTTPS throughout

  * Input validation & rate limiting

* **Scalability:**

  * Designed for 10k+ users

  * API-first to support future mobile app

* **Accessibility:**

  * WCAG AA compliance

  * Keyboard navigation & screen-reader labels

* **Maintainability:**

  * Modular frontend components (e.g., React)

  * Well-documented RESTful or GraphQL API

| **Task** | id, user\_id (FK), title, description, category\_id, start\_date, due\_date, completed\_at |
| **Category** | id, user\_id (FK), name |
| **Streak** | id, user\_id (FK), current\_streak\_count, last\_completed\_date |
| **PointEvent** | id, user\_id (FK), task\_id (nullable), points, event\_date |
